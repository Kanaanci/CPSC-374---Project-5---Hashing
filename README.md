# CPSC-374---Project-5---Hashing
Project 5 of Algorithms and Data Structures class

Project 5: Lincoln’s vocabulary – HashMaps & TreeMaps I will provide you with data files call lincoln.txt and lincoln2.txt, but the program should work for any text file. Open the file, with the usual exceptions taken care of  •	Read a line of text •	Convert the text to all uppercase (String method) •	Replace everything except the letters A-Z with a space: “I-Can’t!” becomes “I CAN T” •	The spaces will now be assumed to delimit words – I am letting T become a word rather than worry about single quotes versus apostrophes. •	Count each word by o	If it is not already in a hash table, add it o	Otherwise, add one to the number of times this word has been seen •	Repeat to end of file  •	Sort the hash table using a Java TreeMap (red-black tree) •	Using an iterator, print each word and the count of how many times it occurred, one per line in alphabetical order. Part of the goal here is to make you use a hashmap<String, Integer> and a treeMap, so don’t implement using arrays, arrayLists, etc
